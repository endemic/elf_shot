TODO
=====

* Detect which point (left or right) has ended when using virtual joysticks
* Modify "homing" shots to either be slower/destroyable or else not zoom in quite as fast on the player
* Create 'tank' and 'factory' enemy types
* Figure out a way for enemies to spawn in deterministic patterns - either hard-code layouts, or programmatically place
	based on the # of total enemies in a level
